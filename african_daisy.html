            <h3>Selecting the Right African Daisy Variety</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Start by choosing the African daisy variety you want to grow. These daisies come in various colors, including
                purple,
                pink, white, and orange. Make sure to select a variety that suits your garden's color scheme and climate.

            <h3>Choosing the Ideal Location</h3>
            <br>
            <p>African daisies thrive in full sun, so choose a sunny spot in your garden that receives at least 6-8 hours of
                direct
                sunlight daily. Well-draining soil is essential to prevent waterlogging and root rot, so ensure your chosen
                location has
                good drainage.</p>

            <h3>Planting African Daisy Seeds or Young Plants</h3>
            <br>
            <p>You can grow African daisies from seeds or purchase young plants from a nursery. If planting from seeds, sow
                them
                directly in the garden or in containers after the last frost date in your area. If using young plants,
                transplant them
                into your selected location, spacing them about 12-18 inches apart.

            <h3>Watering and Care</h3>
            <br>
            <p>African daisies are relatively drought-tolerant once established, but they do require consistent moisture
                during their
                initial growth phase. Water them deeply but infrequently to encourage deep root growth. Avoid overhead
                watering to
                prevent fungal diseases. Apply a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer during the growing season to promote
                healthy blooms.

            <h3>Pruning and Maintenance</h3>
            <br>
            <p>African daisies benefit from deadheading (removing spent flowers) to encourage continuous blooming.
                Additionally, you
                can lightly trim back the plants after the first flush of flowers to promote bushier growth and more blooms.
                In areas
                with harsh winters, provide a layer of mulch around the base of the plants to protect them from cold
                temperatures.

            <h1>Bonus Tips</h1>
            <br>
            <p>- African daisies can attract pollinators like bees and butterflies, so they can be a valuable addition to
                pollinator-friendly gardens.
                - Keep an eye out for common garden pests like aphids and slugs. Take appropriate measures to control them
                if needed.
                - Divide and replant African daisies every few years to rejuvenate older plants and encourage vigorous
                growth.
